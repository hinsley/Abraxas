# Timeline

## March 2019

- Begin project
- Working CPU emulator
- Simple ship assets
  - Basic flight mechanics
    - Rotating thrusters
    - Landing gear
    - Player can walk around on ships

### Week 4

- [ ] Working CPU emulator
- [ ] Simple ship flight

## April 2019

- Rotating thrusters
- Landing gear

### Week 1

- [ ] Walking around on ship and on land seamlessly
  - Default to planetary gravitation
  - Allow player to add a gravity modifier to ships (Is this actually necessary? We could instead just make the player "stick" to the floor; he would be fully affected by typical physics when in air.)
  - [ ] Player (not ship) rotation in mid-air
    - [ ] Roll
    - [ ] Pitch
    - [ ] Yaw
